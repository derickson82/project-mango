# Project Mango

This is a role-playing game, with very simple 2D tile-based graphics, with more focus on developing a rich world and strategic gameplay.

## Technical Details

This project is based on Slick2D a light 2D wrapper around lwjgl, and should run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

We are using [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) to build the maps and tilesets used.

Eclipse project files are checked in, and configured to run with Java 7.

Ant build scripts are also included, and will be used to automate builds and releases.
